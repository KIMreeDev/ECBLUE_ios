"剧烈运动时，体内盐分随大量的汗液排出体外，饮水过多会使血液的渗透压降低，破坏体内水盐代谢平衡，影响人体正常生理功能，甚至还会发生肌肉痉挛现象。由于运动时，需要增加心跳、呼吸的频率来增加血液和氧气，以满足运动需要。而大量饮水会使胃部膨胀充盈，妨碍膈肌活动，影响呼吸;血液的循环流量增加，加重了心脏负担，不仅不利于运动，还会伤害心脏。此外，大量饮水会使胃酸浓度降低，影响食物消化。长期大量运动后饮水容易得胃病。" = "Strenuous exercise, the body salts with a lot of sweat eduction body outside, drinking too much will reduce the osmotic pressure of blood, destruction of water and salt metabolism balance inside body, affect human body normal physiological function and muscle cramps occur even.

"整理活动，是指在体育锻炼后，所采用的一系列放松练习和运动后按摩等恢复手段，目的是消除疲劳，恢复体能，提高锻炼效果。整理活动可以使紧张的肌肉得到放松，在运动中，肌肉毛细血管大量开放，肌肉高度紧张。如果激烈运动后立即静止不动，肌肉内淤积的血液就不能及时流回心脏，肌肉僵硬，疲劳不易消除。相反，运动后做一些整理活动，使运动慢慢缓和下来，或通过按摩挤压肌肉和穴位，就可以使肌肉得到充分的放松和休息。" = "After finishing activities, refers to the physical exercise, adopted a series of recovery means such as massage relaxation exercise and after exercise, the purpose is to eliminate fatigue, restore physical strength, improve the effect of exercise.
